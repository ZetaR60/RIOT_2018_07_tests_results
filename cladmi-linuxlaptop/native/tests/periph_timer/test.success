Test for peripheral TIMERs

This test will test all configured peripheral timers of the
targeted platform. For each timer, it will set each channel with
an incrementing timeout. CH0 set to 5ms, CH1 to 10ms, CH2 to 15ms
and so on.
In the output you should see that every channel fired, after an
evenly distributed amount of time -> the shown diff values should
be pretty much equal (to some jitter...)
This test does however NOT show, if the timeouts were correct in
relation to the expected real-time ~ use e.g. tests/xtimer_msg for
this.


Available timers: 1

Testing TIMER_0:
TIMER_0: initialization successful
TIMER_0: stopped
TIMER_0: set channel 0 to 5000
TIMER_0: starting
TIMER_0: channel 0 fired at SW count  3322599 - init:  3322599

TEST SUCCEEDED
